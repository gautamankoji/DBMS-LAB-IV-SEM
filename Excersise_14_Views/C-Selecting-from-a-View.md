# Exercise â€“ 14

## For a given set of relation tables perform the following:

### (c). Selecting from a View

Once you've created a view, you can query it just like you would a regular table. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails;
```

This statement would select all rows and columns from the `EmployeeDetails` view.

Make sure to replace `EmployeeDetails` with the actual name of the view you created. Also, ensure that the underlying tables exist and contain the necessary data before creating the views.
